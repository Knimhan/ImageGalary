# ImageGalary
- Implement a picture gallery, which can contain any number of pictures. The number and URLs of the pictures is configured on an instance basis.
- As sample images you can use something like Lorempixel or Placekitten, e.g. http://lorempixel.com/600/350/?1 ( http://lorempixel.com/600/350/?1 ), http://lorempixel.com/600/350/?2 ( http://lorempixel.com/600/350/?2 ), ...
- There should be one button to go to the next image and one to go back. If the user is currently viewing the first image, pressing the “previous button” should show him the last image. Analogously to this, when viewing the last image, pressing the “next button” should take him to the first image.
- A counter should be shown, indicating the current image shown out of how many (eg. 3/12).
- Only use plain JavaScript without any big frameworks (like jQuery, AngularJS, lodash, etc.).
- If you use some kind of build pipeline (Gulp, Grunt, Rollup, etc.), include it in the repository as well.
- Provide a demo page with some usage examples.
- The gallery should also support swiping on mobile devices (mobile phones and tablets).
- Use animations to change the images.
